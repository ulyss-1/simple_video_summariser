"""Analyzer service entrypoint (issue #33; architecture.md 1, 11.1, 11.5).

``python -m services.analyzer.main`` runs one long-lived worker (#13) that
claims only ``analyze`` jobs and hands each to the analyze handler (#30). The
summarizer backend comes from the single ``SUMMARIZER`` setting through
``adapters.summarize.factory.build_summarizer``; it is built once and reused
for every job.

Startup order matters, because a bad configuration must fail here and not on
the first job:

1. read the settings and configure logging; invalid settings exit with code 2;
2. build the summarizer (this makes no network call); a configuration that can
   never work, such as ``SUMMARIZER=anthropic`` without a key, exits with
   code 2 -- still before any database connection is opened;
3. log ``analyzer.started`` and run the worker.

A database that is down at startup is handled like one that goes down mid-run:
the connection is opened lazily by the worker's own claim loop, so the process
logs, backs off (capped at 60 s) and retries instead of exiting.

The analyzer shares no code path with the transcriber: this package imports
nothing from ``services.transcriber`` or ``adapters.transcription``, so it
runs in the backend image, which has no Whisper (architecture.md 11.1).

Documents

- `_docs/process.md` - how work is organized
- Before writing tests, read `_docs/testing-guidelines.md`
- For anything touching the UI, read `_docs/design-system.md`
- `_docs/architecture.md` is the spec; `_docs/tasks.md` is the backlog.
  `_docs/plan.md` is the superseded design draft - read it for rationale
  only, and prefer architecture.md wherever they disagree

Environment

- All work happens inside WSL (Ubuntu 26.04, system Python 3.14), which is
  the same distro and Python minor version as the deploy target. Services
  themselves run in `python:3.14-slim` (Debian), so parity holds at 3.14,
  not at the exact interpreter build. Node 24 in WSL matches
  `node:24-alpine`.
- The repo lives in the WSL filesystem at `~/projects/simple_video_summary`.
  Windows can still reach it through `\\wsl.localhost\...`, so never run
  `python`, `pip`, `pytest` or `npm` from PowerShell or CMD: a `.venv`
  built on Windows has `Scripts/*.exe` and one built in WSL has `bin/`.
  Mixing them silently breaks the environment.
- The Docker daemon is Docker Desktop on Windows, exposed to WSL through
  its integration. There is no `dockerd` in the distro - do not install
  one, and do not `service docker start`.
- Open the repo through VS Code Remote-WSL or from the distro. Editing it
  with Windows-side tools over `\\wsl.localhost` is slow and bypasses the
  Linux toolchain.
- Node comes from nvm, so `node` and `npm` are on `PATH` only in login or
  interactive shells. Non-interactive wrappers need `bash -lc`.

Setup

- `sudo apt install python3.14-venv` - once per machine; stock Ubuntu ships
  `python3.14` without `ensurepip`, so `python3.14 -m venv` fails without it
- `python3.14 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.backend.txt -e ".[dev]"` - runtime and dev
  dependencies. `requirements.whisper.txt` is deliberately not installed on
  the host because it adds ~2 GB. Wheels for 3.14 are no longer in doubt:
  on 2026-09-27, `faster-whisper` 1.2.1 with `ctranslate2` 4.8.2 and its
  whole tree installed from wheels and transcribed in `python:3.14-slim`
  (task #4, O7, architecture.md §16.2)

Commands

Activate `.venv` first; all Python commands assume it.

- `pytest -m "not integration"` - fast tests, no Docker needed
- `pytest` - the whole suite; requires Docker Desktop running
- `pytest tests/test_queue.py` - one test file
- `ruff check .` and `mypy .` - lint and types
- `docker compose run --rm migrate` - apply migrations
- `docker compose up -d --build` - bring the stack up
- `npm ci && npm run build` - in `web/`, frontend only

If your shell is on the Windows side rather than in the distro, wrap the
command instead of running it directly:

- `wsl.exe -e bash -lc 'cd ~/projects/simple_video_summary && . .venv/bin/activate && pytest'`

Rules

- Dependencies live in four places: runtime Python deps in
  `requirements.backend.txt`, speech-to-text-only deps in
  `requirements.whisper.txt` (this split keeps ~2 GB out of every other
  image), dev tooling in `pyproject.toml`, frontend deps in
  `web/package.json`. Do not add one without asking, and do not move one
  across that boundary.
- Import direction is `services/ -> adapters/ -> common/`. Nothing in
  `common/` imports an adapter; nothing in `adapters/` imports a service.
- Migrations run as a standalone command, never automatically on startup.
  Concurrent replicas racing the same migration can corrupt the schema.
- Tests that need a real Postgres are marked `integration`.
- Tests run on the host, not in a container - `tests/` is excluded by
  `.dockerignore` and is absent from every image.
- `compose.override.yml` is auto-merged locally. Deploying to the server
  uses `docker compose -f compose.yml up -d` explicitly, so the dev
  overlay can never be applied by accident.

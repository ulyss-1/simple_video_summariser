"""Media repository: retention queries (issue #36; architecture.md §6 ``media``, §7.2).

``media.path`` is relative to ``AUDIO_DIR``. This module holds the queries
the planner's audio retention needs: what is expired, what is oldest, how many
bytes are recorded, which paths are referenced, and the lock-recheck-delete
step that lets retention delete one row safely while a transcriber may be
working on the same video. ``register_media`` / ``delete_media`` (#29) are the
transcribe handler's own writes.

Like every ``common/repo/`` function these take a psycopg connection first,
use parameterized SQL and never commit or roll back.

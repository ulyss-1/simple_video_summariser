# Progress

Status of the groomed backlog (GitHub issues #1–#20), worked through per
`_docs/process.md`. An issue is closed only after a QA PASS comment.

## Checkpoint 3 — 2026-09-28, batch 2 (#21-#40): 5 closed

All 20 issues of batch 2 (#21-#40) were groomed first; follow-ups #80-#105

## Checkpoint 2 — 2026-09-27, 17 of 20 closed

Closed after QA PASS since checkpoint 1: #6 logging, #7 database bootstrap
(2nd QA, after the dev-network fix), #8 core schema, #9 jobs, #10 media,
#11 queue, #14 repository layer (2nd QA, after the test-marker fix),
#16 metadata adapter, #17 VTT parser (2nd QA), #18 subtitles, #19 audio
(2nd QA, after the real-ffmpeg ENOSPC fix), #20 faster-whisper adapter.
Out-of-backlog bug #71 (Alembic disabling loggers) groomed, fixed, closed.

Still open:

- #3 bake-off harness: passes everything except the deploy-host run;
  containerizing it is #76 (being groomed), deploy-host preparation is a
  separate follow-up
- #12 queue concurrency suite: committed (76df71e); blocked on #73
  (enqueue race, fix in progress) and #74 (flaky testcontainers first
  connect, fix in progress)
- #13 worker runtime: committed (8c9e38a), in QA

New follow-ups: #72 random test order, #73 enqueue race, #74 fixture
readiness, #75 more enqueue races, #77 clear error when Docker is down.

Dependencies added since checkpoint 1 (owner-approved): `alembic==1.20.0`,
`psycopg[binary]==3.3.6`, `testcontainers[postgres]==4.15.0` (dev),
`faster-whisper==1.2.1` (requirements.whisper.txt).

## Checkpoint 1 — 2026-09-27, 5 of 20 closed

| Issue | Title | Commits | QA |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1 | Project skeleton | 4de9e43 | PASS (2nd run, after `python3.14-venv` was installed) |
| #2 | Subtitle coverage script | 6cf2d4a, b5aab6b | PASS |
| #4 | faster-whisper wheels on 3.14 | a722cd7 | PASS |
| #5 | Configuration module | ebd0856 | PASS |
| #15 | Error taxonomy | f8afd58 | PASS |

Dependencies added (owner-approved): `yt-dlp==2026.8.19`,
`pydantic-settings==2.15.0`, `structlog==26.1.0` (with #6, in QA).

### Phase 0 findings

- **O7 resolved (#4):** faster-whisper 1.2.1 and its whole tree (ctranslate2
  4.8.2, av 18.1.0, tokenizers 0.23.2, onnxruntime 1.30.0) install from wheels
  on `python:3.14-slim`; no 3.13 transcriber image needed. The single
  `--platform manylinux_2_28_x86_64` download check gives a false negative;
  see architecture §16.2.
- **Subtitle coverage (#2),** 9 owner-chosen channels, 15 RSS entries each:
  manual 6 videos (1.95 h), auto-only 64 (48.72 h), none 0, error 2
  (transient), 63 Shorts excluded. Speech-to-text load is ~0 by default and
  ~48.7 h per this window with `PREFER_WHISPER=1`. Input for #64.

### In flight

- #6 structured logging — committed 2dd0695, in QA
- #17 WebVTT parser — QA FAIL (leading-zero numeric entity raises
  `ValueError`; whitespace-only input returns `[]`), fix in progress
- #16 metadata adapter, #7 database bootstrap — in implementation

### Follow-ups filed (not groomed yet)

- #69 map yt-dlp "rate-limited by YouTube" to `RATE_LIMITED`
- #70 config secrets leak via `ValidationError.errors()`; TID251 rule untested

### Blocked or owner-dependent

- #3 bake-off must run on the deploy host with real clips
- #20 speech-to-text adapter: unblocked by #4; also check #64 first

"""Audio retention (issue #36; architecture.md D6b, §6 ``media``, §7.2).

``enforce_audio_retention`` is one pass that keeps ``AUDIO_DIR`` bounded:

1. **Expiry** - retained audio whose ``expires_at`` has passed is deleted.
2. **Cap** - the oldest audio (``created_at``, then ``id``) is evicted until
   the total *recorded* size (``SUM(media.bytes)``, never a ``stat``) is at or
   below ``max_bytes``. Rows still inside their retention window are evicted
   too when the cap demands it.
3. **Orphans** - regular files under ``AUDIO_DIR`` that no ``media`` row
   references are deleted once their mtime is older than ``ORPHAN_GRACE``:
   files left behind by deleted videos, and ``.download-*`` / ``.tmp-*``
   leftovers of a crashed fetch.

Audio of a video with a ``running`` job is never deleted in phases 1 and 2.
Each row is handled in its own transaction: lock it with ``FOR UPDATE SKIP
LOCKED``, re-check eligibility on the locked row, unlink the file, delete the
row, commit. A row another connection holds is skipped, not waited on.

``media.path`` is data, not trusted: see ``resolve_media_path``.

Scheduling and the singleton guard belong to the planner entrypoint (#38).

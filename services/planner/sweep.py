"""Re-analysis sweep (issue #37; architecture.md §4, C4).

``run_reanalysis_sweep`` is one pass, called by the planner loop (#38) on each
tick. It enqueues one low-priority ``analyze`` job for every video that has a
stored transcript but no analysis at the current ``PROMPT_VERSION``, so bumping
the version re-analyses the corpus without re-downloading or re-transcribing.

Videos whose ``analyze`` job at this key is ``pending``, ``running`` or
``dead`` are skipped: ``dead`` because re-enqueueing would bypass
``max_attempts`` (the ops view, #44, is the retry path). A database error
propagates unchanged; jobs enqueued before it stay, and the next run skips them.

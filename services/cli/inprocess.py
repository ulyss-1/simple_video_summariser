"""The in-process ``JobQueue`` behind ``ytdigest run`` (issue #31).

It keeps jobs in memory and never touches the ``jobs`` table, so a CLI run can
never claim, duplicate or strand a job that belongs to the running workers.
There is no retry: an exception raised inside ``claim`` goes straight back to
the caller, and the job is not put back.

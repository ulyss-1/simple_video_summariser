"""Channel polling (issue #34; architecture.md D9b, §4 priority bands).

``poll_channels`` is one pass: it fetches every active channel's RSS feed
once, records each unseen video published *after* the channel's
``monitor_from`` with ``origin='rss'`` and queues an ``ingest`` job for it.
Older entries are ignored completely, so a later backfill (#41) still finds
them unseen.

Each new video's row and its job are written in one transaction, so a crash
never leaves a video recorded without its job. One broken feed, or one
failing channel, is recorded on that channel and never stops the others.
Database connection errors are the exception: they propagate, and the
planner loop (#38) handles the retry.

Scheduling, the singleton guard and reconnecting belong to #38.

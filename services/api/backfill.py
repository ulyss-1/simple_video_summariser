"""Channel backfill (issue #41; architecture.md 4, 8.3; D9b, C4).

``backfill`` lists a channel's newest ``limit`` uploads through a
``CatalogSource`` and, unless it is a dry run, gives every video the system
does not know yet a ``videos`` row (``origin = 'backfill'``) and one
``ingest`` job at ``PRIORITY_BACKFILL``. It is plain Python with no HTTP, so
the route only maps its result and errors.

Transactions:

- The channel-existence check is committed before the listing starts, so a
  slow yt-dlp run holds no lock or snapshot.
- Each new video is one transaction: row, then job only if this call
  inserted the row. A crash or a database error leaves every video either
  complete or absent, and a repeat call fills in the rest. A concurrent
  writer (RSS, another backfill) that inserted the row first wins; its job
  and origin are left alone.

A ``PermanentSourceError`` from the catalog means "The playlist does not
exist", which yt-dlp prints for a channel with no uploads as well as for a
removed one (#27, #107), so it is reported as an empty listing.
